# Flash card

This is a simple flash card app to memorize words in other languages, I used japanese kanji and their meanings in romaji.

This challenge teaches the concepts of:

 - Tkinter widgets
 - Widgets
 - Grid Colspan
 - Pandas
 - Time in tkinter
 - File handling

## Setup

This program uses the Python Tkinter module, random and pandas.

```
pip install pandas
```

Since it uses japanese fonts to display the kanji characters you may not have them in your system, to check what fonts do you have in your system, run:

```
python fonts.py
```

The list could be pretty small, I'm using Mincho fonts, in Ubuntu you can install them with:

```
sudo apt install fonts-takao
```

## How to run

```
python main.py
```
